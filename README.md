# NodeRESTAPI

## Description
Welcome to my NodeRESTAPI repository! This is a RESTful API built using Node.js, Express.js, and TypeScript, designed to provide CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for user and product models. The API utilizes MongoDB as the database for storing and retrieving data, and it also features user authentication and authorization through JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure login and registration processes
